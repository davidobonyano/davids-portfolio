        description: "A comprehensive school management platform serving students from KG1 to SS3. It features dedicated dashboards for administrators, teachers, and students.",
        challenge: "Traditional school management systems are often clunky, expensive, and difficult to navigate for non-technical staff. The challenge was to build a system that was incredibly intuitive yet powerful enough to handle complex data like exam results, fee payments, and automated timetabling without overwhelming the user.",
        solution: "We developed a modular architecture using Next.js and Supabase. The interface prioritizes clarity, with distinct dashboards for each user role. Automated result compilation reduced teacher workload by 60%, and the integrated payment gateway streamlined fee collection for parents."

        challenge: "The council needed a digital presence that effectively communicated government policies, industry statistics, and pricing data to a diverse audience. The previous system was fragmented and lacked a cohesive content management strategy.",
        solution: "I designed and deployed a robust portal that centralizes all industry data. The system features a custom CMS for easy updates, interactive data visualization for pricing trends, and a responsive design that ensures accessibility for all stakeholders across Nigeria."

        challenge: "Conducting remote examinations carries high risks of malpractice. The client needed a solution that could guarantee the integrity of online tests without requiring invasive software installation on students' devices.",
        solution: "The solution integrates WebRTC and AI-driven behavior analysis directly into the browser. It monitors for suspicious activity (multiple faces, tab switching, absence) and flags incidents in real-time for invigilators, ensuring a secure and fair testing environment."

        challenge: "Finding reliable local artisans (plumbers, electricians) is often a hassle filled with trust issues. Users needed a platform that not only listed services but verified provider identity and facilitated secure, real-time communication.",
        solution: "FixFinder leverages a MERN stack with Socket.io for instant messaging. We implemented Face API to verify provider identities against their profile photos. The location-based search allows users to find help within their immediate vicinity, fostering trust and community."

        challenge: "Job hunting involves tracking hundreds of applications across different stages. Existing tools were either too complex (CRMs) or too simple (spreadsheets), and many required cloud accounts that compromised privacy.",
        solution: "CareerPilot is built as a 'Local-First' application using IndexedDB. All data stays on the user's device. The drag-and-drop Kanban interface makes tracking status intuitive, while the clean, distraction-free UI keeps the focus on the goal: getting hired."
